**Fermat's Last Theorem**: There are no three positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the equation \(a^n + b^n = c^n\) for any integer value of \(n\) greater than 2.

In other words, we can say that *a* raised to *p-1 modulo p* is *equal to 1*, where p is a prime number and a is not divisible by p.

So despite the ridiculously large given number *273246787654 raised to p*, we know that the answer is *1*.
