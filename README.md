# Cryptography Learning Repository

Welcome to my cryptography learning repository! Here you'll find code and solutions to various challenges from [cryptohack.org](https://cryptohack.org/), a platform for learning cryptography through hands-on challenges.

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges provided by CryptoHack. Each challenge is designed to teach and reinforce concepts in cryptography, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and more.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a different category of challenges on CryptoHack.

Each directory contains individual scripts with code solutions, along with comments providing insight. The solutions are written in Python, but the concepts are applicable to other programming languages as well.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring the challenges and solutions:

1. Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the challenge category you're interested in.
3. Review the code solutions provided for each challenge.
4. Experiment with the code, modify it, or try solving the challenges on your own.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you've solved a challenge differently, found a bug, or want to add explanations to existing solutions, feel free to submit a pull request.
